# INFO: Take note of how the value of resource_group_name is set from the properties

# This is how Terraform manages the dependencies between resources. 
# Itâ€™s how Terraform knows the order in which it should execute our script files. 
# This link is how Terraform knows it must create the resource group before it 
# creates the container registry.esources or modules.

# WARN: Use Terraform outputs only for debugging and understanding the infrastructure Terraform has created. 
# We can retrieve the credentials from the Azure Portal or the Azure CLI without saving them in our Terraform state file.
